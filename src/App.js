// Description: In this assignment we are to replicate an Advice Generator website from frontendmentor.io. Using react and bootstrap I have replicated the design as close as possible to the one provided. The advice text comes from an API that generates a random piece of advice when fetched. Must be responsive for desktop and mobile.
